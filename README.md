# MINOR

Source code and supplementary materials for "MINOR: Multivariate Time Series Iterative Cleaning Algorithm".

To facilitate reproducibility, we have open-sourced all the datasets, algorithms, and code presented in the paper, and this document provides a guideline for reproduction.

We used publicly available code sources for the deep leaning baselines:

## **Note**

* Code for all the algorithms in the paper (except for the deep learning baselines) are located in the `MINOR` directory. 
* The code in the `MINOR_py` directory is used for the application experiments in subsection D of Section V.
* Please open these two directories using Java and Python IDEs, respectively.

## Experiments

**Note: Before reproduce results, src/com/MTCSC/pre/RunAllInjection.java is required to be runed first to generate datasets with errors and labels.**

To reproduce the experimental results in this paper, just run a separate Java file. The Java file corresponds to each experimental section as follows.

**Path = MINOR/src/com/MTCSC/experiment/**

**Data = MINOR/data/**

**Result = MINOR/result/**
